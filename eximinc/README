In order to faciliate building on systems that have exim installed but don't
have the exim source, I am including includes from a recent exim version.
While I am keeping track of which version, this shouldn't be necessary as
the local_scan API is supposed to be upward compatible
(technically, we should raise LOCAL_SCAN_ABI_VERSION every time Philip
adds a feature to the API -- Marc)
