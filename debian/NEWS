sa-exim (4.2.1-14) unstable; urgency=low

    If you are using sa-exim's greylisting plugin for SpamAssassin you may
    want to review your setup. Previously the documentation recommended
    running spamd as the "nobody" user. This is not a very good
    recommendation as nobody/nogroup should be completely unprivileged and
    thus not own anything. This version won't change the ownership of any
    directories or files and won't try to fix your SpamAssassin
    configuration, but if you haven't modified /etc/cron.d/greylistclean
    it will be changed to run greylistclean as "Debian-exim", which won't
    work if the greylisting data is owned by nobody:nogroup.

sa-exim (4.2.1-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Since version 4.67-1, exim4 only exports those symbols that are part
    of the official local_scan API. Unfortunately, sa-exim has all along
    cheated and declared some "extern" variables by itself, something that
    no longer works. For one of these, body_linecount, no workaround is
    currently possible, meaning that it will not be updated if the message
    body is rewritten (by way of SpamAssassin's report_safe together with
    SARewriteBody: 1 in sa-exim.conf. This means that if you use
    $body_linecount or $message_linecount in string expansions in your
    Exim configuration, they will refer to the line count before rewriting
    the message body.
  
    This change will hopefully be restored soon, either by extending the
    local_scan API or by making Exim count the lines.
